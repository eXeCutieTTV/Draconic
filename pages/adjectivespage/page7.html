    <p>Adjectives can be in the form of individual words or prepositional phrases. As individual words, they always come
        directly after the noun which they modify, and agree in gender, number, and case. <br>They also have
        declensions,
        and take the exact same set of suffixes as nouns. For example, the adjective texyll (declension 1) means
        “thick.” <br>Notice how it takes different forms to match the noun it describes:
    </p>

    <p>
        Since adjectives follow their own declensions, the suffixes they take may have different forms than the nouns
        they describe. The key is that the suffixes must agree in gender/number/case, not necessarily be identical in
        form.

        All adjectives have a separate “Elative” form, which declines just like the regular form. This form can be used
        as a comparative (meaning “more”), superlative (meaning “most”), or an augmentative (meaning “very”). <br>The
        Elative is formed differently for every adjective: generally, it is formed by either reduplicating the first
        consonant and vowel of the adjective (e.g. fūfū “tinier, tiniest” from fū “tiny”) or by elongating the first
        vowel (e.g. llāz “drier, driest” from llaz “dry”), but there are many irregulars (e.g. thorx “very fragile” from
        thox “fragile”).

        Adjectives can also be derived from prepositional phrases. These must always be directly adjacent to the noun
        phrase, after the noun by default. To say “toothless dragon,” for example, one would literally saying “dragon
        without-teeth.” <br>Possession is marked in this way, using the preposition ħá-. Using prepositional phrases
        like
        this demands no agreement between the adjective and the noun. <br>When required to resolve animacy hierarchy
        disputes, the adjectival phrase can then and only then be placed before the noun, necessitating the object be
        placed in the Recessive case <a href="#"

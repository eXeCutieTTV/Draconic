    <h2>4. Adverbs</h2>
    <p style="width: 80%;">Adverbs can appear in the form of <lilbold>individual</lilbold> words or <lilbold>
            prepositional phrases</lilbold>. <br>As prepositional phrases, they
        typically occur <lilbold>after</lilbold> the verb, often at the <lilbold>end of the clause</lilbold>. When using
        <lilbold>multiple</lilbold> prepositional adverbs in a
        row, the order is typically adverbs of <lilbold>place</lilbold>, then <lilbold>manner</lilbold>, then <lilbold>
            time</lilbold> (similar to English). <br>As individual words,
        adverbs can appear in multiple places. They can be placed at the end of the clause, functioning similarly to
        prepositional phrases. However, it's more common to find them directly <lilbold>before the verb they describe
        </lilbold>. <br>If the
        verb would otherwise be the first word in the clause, this typically triggers a <lilbold>word order switch
        </lilbold>, leaving the
        adverb at the <lilbold>beginning</lilbold> and the rest of the clause becoming <lilbold>SVO</lilbold>. Some (not
        all) of these types of adverbs also
        have <lilbold>Elative</lilbold> forms, which pattern <lilbold>the same as Elative adjectives</lilbold>. They
        imply <lilbold>comparative</lilbold>, <lilbold>superlative</lilbold>, or
        <lilbold>augmentative</lilbold> meanings, and are <lilbold>formed similarly</lilbold> (reduplication or vowel
        elongation, though there are many
        irregulars).
    </p>
    <p>
        Any adjectives can be converted into an adverb by adding the suffix <lilitalic><lilbold>-nyl</lilbold></lilitalic>. This
        suffix is <lilbold>invariable</lilbold> and does not change for elative forms, though it is rarely used for elatives in reality. <br>The Suffix is quite productive, but it can quickly lead to <lilbold>unnaturally</lilbold> or clunky sounding words, especially if another adjective exists that could work just as well, or if an adverb conveying the same purpose already exists.

    <h2>Nouns</h2>
    <p>The most important thing for understanding nouns in Draconic is understanding the gender system. <br>Though we
        are often used to languages that use “masculine” and “feminine” as genders, that's not the only way to do it,
        and plenty of languages across the world define their grammatical genders completely independently of social
        genders. Draconic is one of those languages.</p>
    <p> There are 7 genders in Draconic, which are organized according to an animacy hierarchy. 7 may sound like a lot,
        but genders in Draconic are much simpler than in most European languages for two reasons. <br>For one, most
        gender assignments are logical: you'll rarely have a situation where a word is classed into a gender you
        wouldn't expect. <br>Monstrous beings are in the monstrous gender, magical things are in the magical gender,
        etc. <br>Secondly, gender assignment is transparent: unlike languages like French, where there is often no way
        to tell what word is what gender based on its appearance other than rote memorization, in Draconic, you can
        always tell the gender of a noun based on the very last letter of the word. <br>Below is a list of the 7 genders
        in order, the abbreviation in brackets, what sorts of nouns fall into the category, and what letter the gender
        corresponds with. <br>The first four genders are collectively considered “animate,” and the last three
        “inanimate.” Some aspects of the grammar distinguish between animate and inanimate nouns.</p>

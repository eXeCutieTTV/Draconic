    <h2>2. Nouns</h2>
    <p style="width: 80%;">
        The most important thing for understanding nouns in Draconic is understanding the <lilbold>gender system
        </lilbold>. <br>Though we
        are often used to languages that use “masculine” and “feminine” as genders, that's not the only way to do it,
        and plenty of languages across the world define their grammatical genders completely independently of social
        genders. Draconic is one of those languages.
    </p>
    <p style="width: 80%;">
        There are <lilbold>7</lilbold> genders in Draconic, which are organized according to an <lilbold>animacy
            hierarchy</lilbold>. 7 may sound like a lot,
        but genders in Draconic are much simpler than in most European languages for two reasons. <br>For one, most
        gender assignments are logical: you'll rarely have a situation where a word is classed into a gender you
        wouldn't expect. <br>Monstrous beings are in the monstrous gender, magical things are in the magical gender,
        etc. <br>Secondly, gender assignment is <lilbold>transparent</lilbold>: unlike languages like French, where
        there is often no way
        to tell what word is what gender based on its appearance other than rote memorization, in Draconic, you can
        always tell the gender of a noun based on the very last letter of the word. <br>Below is a list of the 7 genders
        in order, the abbreviation in brackets, what sorts of nouns fall into the category, and what letter the gender
        corresponds with. <br>The first four genders are collectively considered <lilbold>“animate</lilbold>,” and the
        last three
        <lilbold>“inanimate</lilbold>.” Some aspects of the grammar distinguish between animate and inanimate nouns.
    </p>
    <!-- GenderExplainerText -->
    <include-html src="pages\page2\text\genderexplainertext.html"></include-html>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; width: 80%;">
        Often, a single root can be classed into different genders depending on context. <br>For example, the root
        <lilitalic>qūrax</lilitalic>
        refers to things that are very tall. It can mean “altitude” in the Abstract (<lilitalic>qūraxyq̇</lilitalic>),
        “mountain” in the
        Mundane (<lilitalic>qūraxyrk</lilitalic>), “volcano” in the Magical (<lilitalic>qūraxōχ</lilitalic>), etc.
        <br>Thus, learning just a single new root often
        results
        in learning a bunch of new terms, very often with <lilbold>related meanings</lilbold> that fit the gender.
        <br>Plus, this system is
        <lilbold>largely productive</lilbold>, which means you can coin new words with it all the time. For example, you
        can usually take
        any root and put it in the Abstract to make a noun meaning the general concept of the root. So if the root
        <lilitalic>lli</lilitalic>
        means “sister,” then <lilitalic>lliq̇</lilitalic> could mean the concept/idea of a sister, or a bond between
        sisters, or sisterhood.
        <br>Even if a word is not available in the dictionary, feel free to play around and coin new words as long as:
    </p>
    <!-- Aslongas -->
    <include-html src="pages\page2\text\aslongas.html"></include-html>
    <p style="margin-top: 0px">
        Note that sometimes, words may historically diverge from what they originally meant, so you may end up with
        multiple definitions under the same word that don't really make sense any more. <br>The root trotry means
        <lilitalic>“giggle”</lilitalic>
        in the Abstract (<lilitalic>trotryq̇</lilitalic>), but “shark” in the Irrational (<lilitalic>trotryllūl
        </lilitalic>). These two senses seem entirely
        unrelated; however, the root trotry originally meant “toothy,” or “having many teeth.” <br>Abstractly, this was
        interpreted as showing your teeth, smiling, and eventually giggling. <br>But in the Irrational, this was taken
        to be
        a toothy animal: a shark. <br>So words that have etymological connections may have evolved to have their related
        definitions seem more opaque.
    </p>
    <p style="width: 80%;">
        The manifestation of each root in each gender is a little more complicated than a simple suffix. Draconic has
        four declensions, which each take different suffixes depending on the gender. <br>Every root is associated with
        a
        different declension as listed in the Dictionary. For example, the exhalted singular suffix
        can
        be -ēn, -æn, or -ħán, depending on the declension. <br>So the root <lilitalic>tutuŋ</lilitalic> is declension 3
        and becomes <lilitalic>tutuŋēn</lilitalic>,
        <br>the
        root <lilitalic>hāxær</lilitalic> is declension 2 and becomes <lilitalic>hāxæræn</lilitalic>, <br>and the root
        mân is declension 4 and becomes <lilitalic>mânħán</lilitalic>.
        <br>There is no
        rule for how to predict what declension a word will be in, though there are some <lilbold>generalities</lilbold>
        :
    </p>

    <!-- DeclensionGenerals -->
    <include-html src="pages\page2\text\declensiongenerals.html"></include-html>
    <p style="width: 80%;">
        The table of all the suffixes given a
        declension is in the Dictionary.
        <!-- IS IN THE DICTIONARY? MAKE SURE TO DOUBLE CHECK IF YOURE USING HUMANS DICTIONARY OR YOUR OWN ETC -->
    </p>
    <p style="width: 80%;">
        Nouns also decline for number and case. <br>There are three grammatical numbers: <lilbold>singular,</lilbold>
        <lilbold>dual,</lilbold> and <lilbold>plural.</lilbold> <br>For
        mass nouns and nouns in inanimate genders (Magical, Mundane, and Abstract), there is only a singular/plural
        distinction. <br>Pronouns in the language reflect two cases: <lilbold>Subject</lilbold> and <lilbold>Oblique
        </lilbold> (the same difference between
        “he”
        and “him,” “I” and “me,” etc.). <br>There are two separate grammatical cases for all other nouns: <lilbold>
            Directive</lilbold> and
        <lilbold>Recessive.</lilbold> <br>The difference between these two is a little complicated:
    </p>

    <!-- DirRec -->
    <include-html src="pages\page2\text\dirrec.html"></include-html>
    <p style="width: 80%;">

        Nine times out of ten, you can just use the Directive without thinking
        about it.
        <a href="reference">Read more about reccesive here.</a> <!-- MAKE SURE TO LINK TO THE RIGHT PAGE -->
    </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 33px; width: 80%;">
        Nouns will have different forms depending on gender, number, and case. Take, for example, <lilitalic>trærūn
        </lilitalic>, a declension 4
        root meaning “uncle.” <br>Below is the suffix table for declension 4 Exalted nouns:
    </p>
    <!-- Exalted4 table -->

    <include-html src="pages\page2\tables\exalted4table.html"></include-html>
    <p style="width: 80%;">
        For example, the suffix -q̇yn simultaneously encodes that the word is Exalted, the word is plural, and the words
        is the Directive case. <br>So if we apply the root trærūn, we get:
    </p>
    <!-- Exalted4 example table -->
    <include-html src="pages\page2\tables\exalted4exampletable.html"></include-html>
    <p style="width: 80%;">
        Here we see how we could say “uncle,” “(2) uncles,” and “(more than 2) uncles,” in both <lilbold>cases</lilbold>
        . <br>The suffixes will
        be different depending on declension and gender. <br>A full set of all suffixes for all genders and declensions
        is
        available <a href="reference">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p style="width: 80%;">
        A handful of nouns, referred to as <lilbold>“defective</lilbold>,” do not inflect for case, and always use the
        Directive forms.
        <br>This includes some native nouns, but most <lilbold>loanwords</lilbold>. <br>As such, speakers are unlikely
        to use defective nouns in
        positions that would cause ambiguity through a lack of case marking, like in fronting objects of higher animacy
        (<a href="reference">see more here)</a>. <br>Additionally, defective nouns are unlikely to be used in the
        derivation of new words, or to
        be inflected into genders not listed in the dictionary.

        Draconic is an especially <lilbold>noun-heavy</lilbold> language—wherever possible, it will refrain from using
        other parts of
        speech when nouns can do the trick. <br>As such, Draconic will often take various parts of speech and <lilbold>
            nominalize</lilbold>
        them, treating them as nouns. <br>Adjectives for example can simply be treated as nouns once the proper
        <lilbold>
            suffix</lilbold>
        is applied, so a word such as <lilitalic>χentōd</lilitalic>, “special/ chosen,” or <lilitalic>rāreχ</lilitalic>,
        “warm,” can be declined like <lilitalic>χentōdēn</lilitalic>,
        “(exalted) chosen one” or <lilitalic>rāreχōrk</lilitalic>, “(mundane) warm things.” Typical nominal suffixes are
        applied
        designating <lilbold>gender</lilbold>, <lilbold>number</lilbold>, and <lilbold>case</lilbold>.
    </p>
    <p style="width: 80%;">
        <lilbold>Determiners</lilbold> can also be used in this way: to say “this one” or “all of them,” one can simply
        say “this” or
        “all,” provided the words are inflected properly for gender. <br>Note that such forms may be <lilbold>ambiguous
        </lilbold> in terms of
        number and case. The use of <lilbold>distal demonstratives</lilbold> can not only indicate <lilbold>physical
        </lilbold> proximity, but also <lilbold>social</lilbold> or
        <lilbold>contextual</lilbold> proximity, or even <lilbold>obviation</lilbold>. <br>Though nominalized adjectives
        must follow the <lilbold>animacy hierarchy</lilbold> (<a href="reference">see more here</a>), nominalized
        determiners do not, although both obey the presumed agency hierarchy.
    </p>
    <p style="width: 80%;">
        Draconic’s proclivity for nominalization often means that nouns will be referred to by simply its attribute.
        <br>For
        example, a sentence like “the kind dragon gave much gold to the tall human” may very well be said like “the
        kind(ex.) gave much(mun.) to the tall(r.),” even if there isn’t explicitly mention of what each nominalized
        adjective is particularly referring to. <br>This is able to remain largely unambiguous in context thanks to the
        gender system, which shows that each nominalization clearly refers to a different referent.

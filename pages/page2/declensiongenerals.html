    <p>
        The manifestation of each root in each declension 4 is often associated with Emphatic sounds. <br>
        Declensions 1 and 3 are the most common, especially in roots ending
        in vowels. <br>Typically, newly derived words or loanwords will be placed into declension 1. <br>Sometimes, two
        roots can look identical but have different meanings in different declensions.

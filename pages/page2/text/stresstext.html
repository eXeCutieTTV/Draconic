    <p>- stress of a word is initially determined by it's root, ignoring all prefixes/suffixes </p>
    <p>- stress is on the final syllable of the root if it is a closed syllable AND contains a long vowel </p>
    <p>- otherwise, stress is on the penult of the root if it is a closed syllable OR contains a long vowel </p>
    <p>- otherwise, stress is on the antepenult of the root </p>
    <p>- if rules determine that the stress falls outside the root, stress can land on prefixes. If there are
        none, stress appears on the first syllable </p>
    <p>- the only exceptions to the stress rule are for the copula lur, explain in the sheet named "To Be" </p>

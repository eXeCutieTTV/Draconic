All prepositions in Draconic are prefixes that attach to the noun (or occasionally its preceding determiner) which they
describe. Draconic does not allow for prepositions to attach to articles: the distinctions between “the king of a land,”
“the king of the land,” and “the king of no land” are all left up to context, all written of “the king of-land.” Often,
definiteness is considered to transfer through to the prepositional phrase. Thus, “king of-land” is typically
interpreted as “(a) king of (a) land,” and “the king of-land” as “the king of the land.” Draconic is reluctant to attach
prepositions to determiners, but can in certain contexts (see section 3.4).

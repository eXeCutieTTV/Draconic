    <p>This is the fourth sheet.</p>

    <p style="width: 80%;">Verbs can take a number of different <lilbold>auxiliaries</lilbold> to encode optional extra information about
        the action, typically
        modal or aspectual. When a phrase contains an auxiliary structure, the auxiliary verb takes the subject prefix,
        and the lexical verb takes the object suffix if applicable. Additionally, the lexical verb is always placed in
        the simple form. If possible, the auxiliary verb takes any tensual or aspectual inflection. However, many
        so-called “defective auxiliaries” cannot inflect for tense or aspect. Some auxiliaries are indistinguishable in
        form from verbs, but can be differentiated through syntax (<a href="reference">see more here</a>).</p>
    <p style="width: 80%;">Finally, many verbs can themselves become auxiliaries. This is done when serializing two
        different verbs that
        share a subject. So a sentence like “the human tries to cook” could be translated as tolliseχħû tyf kālôŋlef
        foxeχ, literally “tries the human cook.” Verbs can only be made auxiliaries in this way if they are transitive
        and could otherwise take the noun form of the following verb as a direct object. For more information on verbal
        subordinate clauses, <a href="reference">see more here</a>.</p>

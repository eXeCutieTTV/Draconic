        <p>This website holds the sole purpose of making the draconic conlang more intuitively accessible for everyone.</p>
        
        <p>Draconic is a conlang made by the youtuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@humanteneleven">Human1011</a> to
            whom all the rights lay, and includes quite a few different and original elements than makes it stand out -
            the most notable example being the gender system - that we will be exploring in this sheet.</p>
        
        <p>This is in essence just a reworked spreadsheet, but it is set up in a way which i personally would find to be
            more intuitive, and less workintensive in use.</p>

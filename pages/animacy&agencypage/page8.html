            <p>Draconic has a strict animacy hierarchy, where nouns of higher animacy must precede words of lower
                animacy in
                a
                sentence. <br>This animacy hierarchy is the exact same as the 7 genders, where Exalted is the most
                animate
                and
                Abstract is the least animate. <br>So in a sentence mentioning a dragon, a human, and a mouse, the
                dragon
                must
                be
                the first noun in the sentence, followed by the human, followed by the mouse. <br>This applies to all
                nouns
                (except
                interrogative pronouns) and only applies to the first instance of using a noun within a sentence.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, Draconic clauses (in declarative sentences) also display a presumptive agency hierarchy, where
                nouns
                with more agency are presumed to come before nouns with less agency within the same clause: <br>i.e.,
                subjects
                come
                before objects, and direct objects before indirect objects. <br>As such, speakers must employ linguistic
                strategies
                in order to maintain the animacy hierarchy and minimize ambiguity from the agency hierarchy.
            </p>
            <p>
                One such strategy involves placing verbs into the passive voice to keep the most animate noun at the
                beginning
                of the sentence. <br>For example, if a speaker wanted to say “the man struck the dragon,” they may be
                inclined
                to
                instead say “the dragon was struck from the man” in order to keep the Exalted noun as the subject (the
                agent
                of
                a passive verb is indicated with “from,” not “by”). <br>Speakers may also shift prepositional phrases
                around
                to
                maintain this hierarchy. <br>If a speaker wanted to say “the dragon gave the coin to the human,” a
                speaker
                could
                say
                “the dragon gave to the human the coin.” <br>Another strategy is to insert an extra clause at the
                beginning
                to
                front
                the more animate noun. Instead of saying “the man struck the dragon,” a speaker may instead say
                something
                like
                “the dragon was flying, and the man struck her.” This satisfies the animacy hierarchy by placing the
                most
                animate noun at the beginning of the sentence, and it satisfies the agency hierarchy by putting the
                highest
                agency noun at the beginning of the clause.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first word in a sentence is typically viewed as the most important, so speakers feel inclined to
                keep
                high
                animacy nouns at the beginning. The passive voice is one way to do this, but speakers often conceive of
                the
                passive voice as indicating weakness, which they don't want to ascribe to high animacy nouns. Therefore,
                the
                most common strategy to resolve animacy violations is with the <a href="#"
                    onclick="event.preventDefault(); openPageAndScroll('pages/nounspage/page3.html', 'page3', { runScripts: true, replace: false}, '.tab-bar .tab:nth-child(5)', 'RecDir')">
                    Recessive case
                </a>

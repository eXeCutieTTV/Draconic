    <h2>Auxilaries</h2>

    <p style="width: 80%;">Verbs can take a number of different <lilbold>auxiliaries</lilbold> to encode optional extra
        information about
        the action, typically
        <lilbold>modal</lilbold> or <lilbold>aspectual</lilbold>. When a phrase contains an auxiliary structure,
        <lilbold>the auxiliary verb takes the subject prefix</lilbold>,
        and <lilbold>the lexical verb takes the object suffix</lilbold> if applicable. <br>Additionally, the lexical
        verb is always placed in
        the <lilbold>simple form</lilbold>. If possible, the auxiliary verb takes any <lilbold>tensual</lilbold> or
        <lilbold>aspectual</lilbold> inflection. <br>However, many
        so-called “<lilbold>defective auxiliaries</lilbold>” <lilbold>cannot</lilbold> inflect for tense or aspect.
        <br>Some auxiliaries are <lilbold>indistinguishable</lilbold> in
        form from verbs, but <lilbold>can</lilbold> be differentiated through syntax (<a href="reference">see more
            here</a>).
    </p>
    <p style="width: 80%;">Many verbs can themselves <lilbold>become</lilbold> auxiliaries. This is done when
        <lilbold>serializing</lilbold> two
        different verbs that
        <lilbold>share a subject</lilbold>. <br>So a sentence like “the human tries to cook” could be translated as
        <lilitalic>tolliseχħû tyf kālôŋlef
            foxeχ</lilitalic>, literally “tries the human cook.” <br>Verbs can only be made auxiliaries in this way if
        they are <lilbold>transitive</lilbold>
        <lilbold>and</lilbold> could otherwise take the noun form of the following verb as a <lilbold>direct object
        </lilbold>. <br>For more information on verbal
        subordinate clauses, <a href="reference">see more here</a>.
    </p>
    <p style="width: 80%;"><br>Below is a dictionary of all the auxiliaries currently available in Draconic:, the
        "Forms" collum includes in said order the episodic past, gnomic non-past and the gnomic past, unless said
        auxilary is "<lilitalic>defective</lilitalic>" meaning it doesnt have other forms. </p>

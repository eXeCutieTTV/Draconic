        The manifestation of each root in each declension 4 is often associated with <strong>Emphatic</strong> sounds. <br>
        Declensions 1 and 3 are the most <strong>common</strong>, especially in roots ending
        in vowels. <br>Typically, <strong>newly derived</strong> words or <strong>loanwords</strong> will be placed into declension 1. <br>Sometimes, two
        roots can look identical but have different meanings in different declensions.

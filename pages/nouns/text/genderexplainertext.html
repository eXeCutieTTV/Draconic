        <strong>1 - Exalted [e.]:</strong> also called “Esteemed,” this gender encompasses anything that dragons would
        consider as
        intelligent, powerful, and worthy of respect. This includes most dragons, deities, and other supremely
        powerful beings. All Exalted nouns end with <strong>"n."</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>2 - Rational [r.]:</strong> this gender refers to any rational, sentient, and intelligent being. The
        most obvious
        example is humans, but it can also refer to other humanoids (elves, dwarves, etc.), to other intelligent
        creatures (angels, fiends, etc.), and to lesser dragons that do not qualify as Exalted (baby dragons,
        wyverns, etc.). It is considered extremely rude to refer to a greater dragon as Rational, not Exalted. All
        Rational nouns end with <strong>“f.”</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>3 - Monstrous [mon.]:</strong> generally the same as Rational, but referring to creatures that are
        bestial or feral,
        typically hostile, but still sentient. This includes spirits, monsters, intelligent beasts, etc. A werewolf,
        for example, may be considered Rational in most circumstances, but Monstrous under the transformation of a
        full moon. All Monstrous nouns end with <strong>“ô,”</strong> or sometimes <strong>“ó.”</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>4 - Irrational [i.]:</strong> generally refers to any non-sentient but animate being. Includes
        animals, plants, and
        sometimes mindless monsters, such as some undead. Can also refer to any thinking thing without a soul, like
        a robot. All Irrational nouns end with <strong>“l,” </strong>often <strong>“llūl.”</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>5 - Magical [mag.]:</strong> refers to any magical object or energy, such as enchanted items, spells,
        mana, etc. Often
        used for non-animate things closely associated with the living (e.g. core body parts). Sometimes used for
        non-magical objects of high cultural significance. Can also refer to particularly powerful phenomena, even
        if technically non-magical (e.g. lightning). All Magical nouns end with <strong>“χ.”</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>6 - Mundane [mun.]:</strong> refers to any non-magical object, typically physical. Also refers to
        manifestations of
        forces, particularly natural phenomena. Occasionally refers to particularly weak magical objects. All
        Mundane nouns end with <strong>“k,”</strong> often <strong>“rk.”</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>7 - Abstract [a.]:</strong> refers to anything abstract or non-physical, such as ideas, concepts, and
        beliefs. Also
        often used to refer to collectives and generalizations. All Abstract nouns end with <strong>“q̇.”</strong>
